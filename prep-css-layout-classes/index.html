        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>Lucas and Spielberg had intended to make a trilogy of Indiana Jones films since Lucas had first pitched Raiders of the
        Lost Ark to Spielberg in 1977.[14] After the mixed critical and public reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
        Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise to Lucas, with the intent to invoke the film with the
        spirit and tone of Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p>
